PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: July 8, 2025

This Privacy Policy outlines how UploadNotifier ("the Bot") handles data while operating in your Discord server.

1. DATA COLLECTED

UploadNotifier only collects and stores the following server-level configuration data:
- Discord Server (Guild) ID
- Notification Channel ID
- Ping Role ID (optional)
- Tracked YouTube channel IDs and display names
- Tracked Twitch usernames and display names

No personal user data (e.g., usernames, message content, DMs) is collected or stored.

2. DATA STORAGE

All data is stored locally on the machine where the bot is hosted in a configuration file (`guild_configs.json`). This data is not transmitted to third parties or remote servers.

3. API USAGE

UploadNotifier uses the following public APIs:
- **YouTube Data API** to retrieve latest video uploads.
- **Twitch API** to check if a streamer is live.

Only publicly available channel data is retrieved. No authentication with user accounts is required or used.

4. DATA SHARING

No data is shared with third-party services or external systems. The Bot does not include advertising, analytics, or user tracking.

5. DATA REMOVAL

To delete your server's data, you may:
- Remove the bot from your server (data is no longer used).
- Contact the developer (VihaanVP) directly to request full data removal.

6. SECURITY

While best efforts are made to secure stored data, the Bot is provided “as is”. The developers are not responsible for unauthorized access due to hosting setup or user misconfiguration.

7. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

This Privacy Policy may be updated in the future. Any major changes will be noted in the project repository.

8. CONTACT

For privacy-related concerns, please contact the developer via GitHub or Discord.

By using UploadNotifier, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
